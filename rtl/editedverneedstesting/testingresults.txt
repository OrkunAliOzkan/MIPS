todo:
	Check each instruction, make sure sign extnesion stuff is done properly.
	Add regwrite implementation in WB. (sort of already done though?)
	Check spec for completeness in HALT/END state.

BASE CODE:			18985/15408 (123%)	FAIL	
Removed opcode==0 sec in WB:	15240/15408 (%)		PASS	Didnt finish?
Removed if(lOp) in WB:		20206/15408 (131%)	FAIL	Got WORSE
Byteenable -> if statements:	19792/15408 (128%)	FAIL	Got WORSE
Remove if for JUMPs		18996/15408 (123%)	FAIL	Got WORSE???? HOW
Remove comb stuff:		9651/15408  (63%)	PASS	Got BETTER
Moved comb stuff to EX		18914/15408 (%)		FAIL	Got better slightly. Still Fail
Removed read/write/regwrite	18995/15408 (123%)	FAIL	Got worse slighly.
Remove jump instructions	18020/15408 (117%)	FAIL	Got better slightly. Still Fail

Need to reduce maybe 30ish lines size if statement in order to pass.

Changes:
	Address at which we write at + bytenable logic. Needs to be sign extended.
		line 153:	OLD: ByteEnableLogic = (register[IR_rs] + { 16'd0, IR_address_immediate }) % 4;
				NEW: ByteEnableLogic = (register[IR_rs] + { 16{IR_address_immediate[15]}, IR_address_immediate }) % 4;

		line 164:	OLD: address = (register[IR_rs] + { 16'd0, IR_address_immediate }) - ByteEnableLogic;
				NEW: address = (register[IR_rs] + { 16{IR_address_immediate[15]}, IR_address_immediate }) - ByteEnableLogic;

	ADDU	CORRECT
	SUBU	CORRECT

	DIV	? Sign extension required?
	DIVU	? Sign extension required?
			Changes: Line 287Need to add section to prevent 0 from being a value.
	
	MULT	? Sign extension required?
	MULTU	? Sign extension required?
			WARNING: 	If either of the two preceding instructions is MFHI or MFLO, the result of the MFHI or
					MFLO is undefined. Reads of the HI or LO special registers must be separated from
					subsequent instructions that write to them, like this one, by two or more other instructions.

	AND	CORRECT
	OR	CORRECT
	XOR	CORRECT

	SLT	CORRECT
	SLTU	CORRECT

	SLL, SLLV, SRL, SRLV Think all are correct. Double check with group. ISA is weird with sign extension.
	SRA, SRAV Think all are correct. Double check with group. ISA is weird with sign extension.

	ANDI	CHANGED (0 extended) Changes: Line 338
	ORI	CHANGED (0 extended) Changes: Line 338
	XORI	CHANGED (0 extended) Changes: Line 338

	MFHI, HFLO, MTHI, MTLO	CORRECT - Look at warning: 	The two instructions that follow an MFHI instruction must not be instructions that
								modify the HI register: DDIV, DDIVU, DIV, DIVU, DMULT, DMULTU, MTHI, MULT,
								MULTU. If this restriction is violated, the result of the MFHI is undefined.

	LUI CORRECT - CHANGED Line 345. Changed from shift to concatonation.
	
	SLTI , SLTIU CORRECT. Double check with tesbenches.
