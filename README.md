1)  Now, read this:<br>
  -  Make a folder called e.g. MIPS <br>
  -  Make two folders within it, one called Requirements <br>
  -  Clone the requirements (link:https://github.com/m8pple/elec50010-2021-cpu-cw) <br>
  -  Read the requirements!!! Make a student github account!<br>
  -  In the other folder, name it e.g. Work Station <br>
  -  Now we will be adding this repository as a remote repository:<br>
  > git remote add origin **link** <br> 
  (link :https://github.com/BigShinyProcessor/MIPS.git) <br>
  
  - You'll notice you'll need to login so I recommend you read the following: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal-access-to
  - Once in, try typing in: <br>
  > git remote <br>

  See how it says **MIPS**? Now you this folder is remotely linked!
  - Now type the following: <br>
  > git push -u origin master <br>

  You should now get a popup that says to login to github.com, just use your student account <br>
  - Make a test txt file saying your name. 
  > git add **filename**.txt <br>
  > git add . <br>
  > > git add *.txt <br>
 Git add . adds everything you 
 > git commit -m '**Your name** input'

- What this does is commits your txt file, basically inserting it. Check on the link to see if it uploaded. This commit will be titled as **your name** input. Think of this as a way to summarise what the commit was used for.
- Notice how your txt file wasn't uploaded? Thats cause you havent yet uploaded it. Hah gacha :3; what you'll now want to do is<br>
> git push
2)  How I advise you use this repo:
- Make a folder for your edits, that way we can tell who is doing what.
